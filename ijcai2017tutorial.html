        Social influence is the behavioral change of a person because of the perceived relationship with other people, organizations and society in general. Social influence has been a widely accepted phenomenon in social networks for decades. Many applications have been built based around the implicit notation of social influence between people, such as marketing, advertisement and recommendations. With the exponential growth of online social network services such as Facebook and Twitter, social influence can for the first time be measured over a large population. 

        In this tutorial, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of models and algorithms on social influence and information diffusion. We first give basic definition of social influence, and introduce how to learn influence probability in large-scale social networks efficiently. Next, we present recent developments of influence and diffusion models. After that, we introduce how social influence benefits other research topics like user emotion modeling and representation learning for social networks. We finally demonstrate how to apply the presented methodologies in real social networks, giving Tencent Game the examples.

        The tutorial will be held at the 26th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Melbourne, Australia on August 19, 2017.
